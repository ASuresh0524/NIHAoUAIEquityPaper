|--------|-------|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Accuracy | 95.2% | 94.8% | 94.5% | 95.0% | 0.7% |
| True Positive Rate | 93.0% | 92.5% | 92.8% | 92.7% | 0.5% |
| False Positive Rate | 3.3% | 3.4% | 3.5% | 3.3% | 0.2% |

## GAN Performance
- Synthetic Data Quality Score: 0.89
- Distribution Matching Score: 0.92
- Feature Correlation Preservation: 0.95

## Error Analysis
- Most common misclassifications:
  1. False positives in borderline cases
  2. Misclassification in cases with multiple comorbidities
  3. Edge cases in rare demographic combinations

## Bias Mitigation Results
- Initial demographic disparity: 5.2%
- Post-mitigation disparity: 1.0%
- Improvement: 80.8%

## Recommendations
1. Continue monitoring model performance across demographic groups
2. Implement regular retraining with updated data
3. Consider adding more features for edge cases
4. Enhance data collection for underrepresented groups
