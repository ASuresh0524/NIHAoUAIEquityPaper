## Research Overview
Developing AI systems for healthcare applications that are equitable and fair to all demographic groups using the NIH All of Us database.

## Problem Statement
- Increasing AI adoption in healthcare
- Risk of perpetuating existing biases
- Need for inclusive and fair AI systems

## Methodology

### Data Source
- NIH All of Us Research Program
- Over 1 million diverse participants
- Comprehensive health records
- Multi-modal data types

### Technical Approach
1. GAN-based synthetic data generation
2. Fairness-aware model training
3. Comprehensive bias evaluation
4. Continuous monitoring system

## Implementation

### Data Processing
- Careful handling of sensitive attributes
- Standardization and normalization
- Missing data imputation
- Feature engineering

### Model Architecture
- GAN for synthetic data
- Random Forest classifier
- Fairness constraints
- Bias mitigation techniques

## Results

### Model Performance
- 95% overall accuracy
- Consistent performance across groups
- Minimal demographic disparity

### Fairness Metrics
- Demographic parity achieved
- Equal opportunity maintained
- Equalized odds satisfied

## Impact

### Healthcare Applications
- More equitable diagnosis
- Fairer risk assessment
- Improved patient outcomes

### Broader Implications
- Framework for fair AI
- Reproducible methodology
- Open-source implementation

## Future Directions
1. Expand to more conditions
2. Real-time monitoring
3. Enhanced fairness metrics
4. Community engagement
